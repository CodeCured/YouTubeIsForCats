# YouTube is for cats ðŸ˜¸

Did you know there are cat videos on YouTube? Yes, really!

This list updates once a day, feel free to [add any missing channels](#add-a-channel). Tap a column's header to sort by that field.

## Add a channel

To add a channel, edit [`channels.txt`](https://github.com/CodeCured/YouTubeIsForCats/blob/main/automation/channels.txt) to include the channel ID and channel name:
* Channel ID can be retrieved from a profile at `About` -> `Share` -> `Copy channel ID`
* Channel name is not used, except to make the file more readable.

Alternatively, drop an email to [youtube@codecured.org](mailto:youtube@codecured.org) and it'll get added.
